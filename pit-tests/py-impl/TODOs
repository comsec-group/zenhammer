- column function may be overlapping with lower addressing functions
	in that case the column function should be masked with the higher
	order bit of that function to have sequential columns

- change DRAMAddr functions so that you can easily import new memory configurations
	at the moment the C implementation only has the two matrices but we can make
	it scale better if we create a MemConfig struct.
